## Creating a Navlog
- After finalising route, writing each point down
- Simplfied wind correction (using slide rule or online calculator)
- Calculating enroute time and fuel requirements (link to Flight Planning section)

## Map Reading
- Use of VTCs in terminal areas, VNCs in surrounding areas, and WACs where necessary
- Choosing easily-identifiable features from the air with lead in features to assist in early recognition

## Ground-to-Map Technique
- Look for major features outside and locate on chart
- Triangulate position based on multiple features
- Use time travelled and estimated GS to estimate distance travelled since last position fix
- Wind adjustment where winds are different to forecast
