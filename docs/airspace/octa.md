*Reconsider the structure of this page. Would prefer to have general rules pertaining to flight OCTA, including the obligations of pilots operating under IFR or VFR SIS, and links to the radio section as necessary*

## IFR
### Taxi at Uncontrolled Aerodrome
- Radio call to be made (link to radio page)
- Requirement to update ATS if departure delay encountered (and expectation that ATS will set ops normal time with you)
- Radio setup (COM1: CTR, COM2: CTAF/unicom)
- Expectation of airways clearance on the ground if departing OCTA aerodrome close to CTA LL

### Airways Clearance after Departure
- Requirement to remain OCTA until in receipt of clearance (set APA to CTA LL)
- Handling of clearance

### Cruise OCTA
- Requirement to inform ATS prior to change of level or track (but no clearance required)
- Use of Area QNH
- Enroute IFR traffic and appropriate actions

### Arrival at Uncontrolled Aerodrome
- Clearance to leave CTA descending
- Traffic statement and appropriate actions (e.g. maintaining 1000ft sep with aircraft on opposing tracks)
- Cancelling SARWATCH (including whilst airborne where VHF coverage is limited)
