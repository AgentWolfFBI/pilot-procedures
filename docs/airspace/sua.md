--8<-- "includes/abbreviations.md"

## Background
- airspace requires prior approval to operate in
- relevance to VATSIM (most SUA is temporarily activated)

## Danger Areas
- How to find details in ERSA
- Replanning to avoid
- Using appropriately designated danger areas (like training areas) to conduct predictable flight training/manoeuvres

## Restricted Areas
- How to find details in ERSA
- RA status and what that means from a flight planning perspective
- How to remain clear laterally and vertically (i.e. boundary level between PRD and other airspace takes on designation of least restrictive airspace type)
- Military restricted airspace and potential civil releases

## Military Operating Areas
