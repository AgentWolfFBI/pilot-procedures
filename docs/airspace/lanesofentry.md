  title: Lanes of Entry
---

--8<-- "includes/abbreviations.md"

## Background
Lanes of entry are pre-defined corridors which provide passage to/from certain Class D aerodromes. They ensure aircraft remain clear of nearby Class C or military airspace.

Details of each lane are found in the Class D aerodrome's ERSA FAC entry. They are also depicted on the relevant VTC as a line of purple dots. Some lanes transit CTA and require an airways clearance.

Details on specific lanes of entry can be found in [Local Procedures](../local-procedures/).

## General Rules
When operating on a lane of entry, the following rules must be abided by:

- Keep to the right
- Remain above the [minimum altitude](./rulesofflight.md#altitude-requirements) over terrain/built up areas
- Broadcast your position and intentions on the designated frequency or Advisory if none exists
- Remain clear of CTA unless you have a clearance to enter
