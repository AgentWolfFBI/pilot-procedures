## Preflight Fuel Planning
### Flight Fuel
- Determining fuel burn and enroute time to calculate fuel burn
- Add climb fuel allowance

### Reserve Fuel
- Final Reserve (ex-Fixed Reserve)
- Contingency Fuel (ex-Variable Reserve)
- Requirement to land with Final Reserve

### Instrument Approach Fuel
- Carried for arrival at destination where weather dictates
- Not required if weather is good but INTER/TEMPO indicates deterioration and INTER/TEMPO fuel carried

### Weather Holding/Alternate Fuel
- INTER/TEMPO
- PROB30/40
- If no change indicator, alternate required
- Alternate must not require its own alternate

### Traffic Holding Fuel
- Finding details in ERSA
- Carrying extra for VATSIM events (MRM, WorldFlight, etc)
    - Dictate actual amounts of traffic holding fuel required for each event?

### Extra Fuel
- Fuel tankering for return leg
- Additional contingencies when flying to isolated aerodrome
- Catering for VATSIM-isms

### Example Fuel Plan
- Sample calculation for aircraft, with TAF requiring INTER/TEMPO and instrument approach

## Inflight Diversion
- Where extensive holding or other factors dictate, perform fuel calculation to determine latest divert time
- Calculate flight fuel from present position to alternate
- Cater for any holding required at alternate (weather, traffic, etc)
- Cater for instrument approach at alternate if required
- Apply conservative buffer to minimum divert fuel, then assess current fuel burn to determine latest divert time
- Advise ATC approaching and reaching divert point

### Inflight Fuel Emergencies
- MINIMUM FUEL and MAYDAY FUEL calls (link to radio page)
