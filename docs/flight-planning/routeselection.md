  title: Route Selection
---

--8<-- "includes/abbreviations.md"

If you intend on remaining outside controlled airspace and away from busy areas & major obstacles, you can generally select the route of your choice. However, if you are planning to enter CTA or visit a major aerodrome, careful route selection will make it considerably easier for ATC to clear you as requested.

## ERSA Preferred Routes
- Preferred routes from A to B in the list first, then:  
- Use as starting point to exit/enter busy TMAs, then use other route planning to connect the two
- If required route is less than ideal, consider departing VFR/OCTA

## VFR Route Selection
- Frequent navigation points to assist with visual navigation
- Routes keeping aircraft clear of CTA/PRD, even if navigation isn't accurate (i.e. applying buffer to these restrictive airspace sectors)
- Considering availability of airways clearance and Plan B if clearance not available

## IFR Route Selection
- Use of ERC H or L depending on intended cruising altitude
- Awareness of grid and route LSALTs where aircraft performance may suffer in event of engine failure or icing

## Altitude Selection
- Hemispherical levels
- VFR +500ft levels

## Designated Remote Areas
- Reference to CAOs
- Requirement to carry survival equipment (not really a consideration for flight sim)

## Use of Third-Party Tools
- Warning about use of SimBrief routes
- Use of ATC Assist to generate route
- Local Procedures section for notes on VFR coded clearances, etc
