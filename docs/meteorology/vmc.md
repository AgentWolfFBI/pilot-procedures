--8<-- "includes/abbreviations.md"

## Background
All VFR aircraft must be operated in VMC unless they are operating under [Special VFR](#special-vfr) in CTA. VMC differs based on airspace classification and aircraft type.

Pilots are responsible for ensuring the current meteorological conditions are sufficient to maintain VMC, and must discontinue a VFR flight or upgrade to IFR where this is not possible.

## VMC
### General
In all airspace classes except [Class D](#class-d), VMC is defined as per below.

| Altitude | Inflight Visibility | Distance from Cloud |
| --- | --- | --- |
| At or above 10,000ft AMSL | 8km | 1,500m horizontal<br>1,000ft vertical |
| Below 10,000ft AMSL | 5km | 1,500m horizontal<br>1,000ft vertical |

Additional flexibilities exist in [Class G](#class-g) airspace.

### Class D
| Altitude | Inflight Visibility | Distance from Cloud |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All altitudes | 5km | 600m horizontal<br>1,000ft vertical above cloud<br>500ft vertical below cloud |

### Class G
In addition to the [general VMC definition](#general), aircraft operating in Class G airspace may operate under the following VMC definition.

| Altitude | Inflight Visibility | Distance from Cloud |
| --- | --- | --- |
| At or below the higher of:<br>3,000ft AMSL<br>1,000ft AGL | 5km | Clear of cloud |

Aircraft must remain **in sight of ground or water** while operating under the VMC definition above.

#### Helicopters
Helicopters have specific VMC criteria in Class G airspace.

| Altitude | Inflight Visibility | Distance from Cloud |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Below 700ft over land<br>Below 700ft over water *with* track guidance from navigation system | 800m | Clear of cloud |
| Below 700ft over water *without* track guidance from navigation system | 5km | 600m horizontal<br>500ft vertical |

The above criteria is only applicable:

- By day
- At a speed that allows the pilot to see obstructions or other traffic in time to avoid a collision
- If within 10nm of an aerodrome with an instrument approach, in a way which maintains at least 500ft vertical separation from any IFR aircraft that is within 10nm of the aerodrome

## Special VFR
By day, where VMC does not exist, VFR aircraft may request a Special VFR clearance to enter or leave CTA or a control zone. Clearance may not be available where it would unduly delay an IFR aircraft.

Aircraft operating under Special VFR must ensure they comply with the criteria below.

| Aircraft Type | Inflight Visibility | Distance from Cloud |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Aeroplanes | 1,600m | Clear of cloud |
| Helicopters | 800m | Clear of cloud |
| Balloons | 100m below 500ft AGL<br>1,600m at or above 500ft AGL | Clear of cloud |

Helicopters operating Special VFR must only do so at a speed which allows the pilot to see obstructions or other traffic in time to avoid a collision.
